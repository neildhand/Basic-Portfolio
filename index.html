			<p>
				I am 23 years old, and I am just trying to find my way in life. In my free time I like to write, read, rap, watch sports and movies, and listen to music. I also enjoy recording my own music. You can find my music on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ill-26">Soundcloud profile</a>. Unfortunately, I haven't learned how to make beats yet, but I do write and rap my own lyrics. Besides music, I also love sports. Basketball is my main sport to play but I still enjoy playing most other sports as well, even the ones I am not so good at like golf. I couldn't really pick a favorite book, but "Be Here Now," written by Ram Dass and "Veronika Decides To Die," by Paulo Coelho are some of my favorite ones. I listen to most genres of music but I predominately listen to rap, reggae, and some old school rock.
